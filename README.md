# Waku + Tanstack Router Proof of Concept

This repo aims to integrate [Waku](https://waku.gg) with the incredible
[Tanstack Router](https://tanstack.com/router).

This is very experimental, and production builds still fail, but it works
flawlessly in dev mode.

To test it, clone this project, and run the following:
```sh
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```
